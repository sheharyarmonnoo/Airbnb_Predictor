# Airbnb_Investment Analysis and Price Estimator 
This project provides insights for Airbnb sellers on the best places to host based on price per night charged and the ideal nightly rate for their neighborhood. 

The project utilizes Python Selenium for web scraping and scikit-learn (sklearn) for machine learning to classify and analyze data. 

- **The problem** we aim to solve was whether airbnb is a profitable business and if so what areas within a state / city / town are the best spots to have hosting
- **The data** we work with is a sample of over ~260 individual listings from the airbnb website all over the united states
